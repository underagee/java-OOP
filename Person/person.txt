The class should also have the following methods:
•	A method to return the full name of the person (first name + last name).
•	A method to return the age of the person.
•	A method to return the gender of the person.
•	A method to return the phone number of the person.

Once you have created the "Person" class, create a driver class that creates a few Person objects and sets and gets their properties.
