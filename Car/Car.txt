Create a Java class Car with the following attributes:
•	make (a string)
•	model (a string)
•	year (an int)
•	speed (a double)
The class should have the following methods:
•	getMake(): This method should return the make of the car.
•	getModel(): This method should return the model of the car.
•	getYear(): This method should return the year of the car.
•	getSpeed(): This method should return the speed of the car.
•	accelerate(): This method should increase the speed of the car by 10 mph.
•	brake(): This method should decrease the speed of the car by 7 mph.
You should also write a Main class that creates two Car objects, sets their attributes, and demonstrates the use of each of the methods.
