Create a class called "Book" that has the following properties:
•	Title (String)
•	Author (String)
•	ISBN (String)
•	Publication Date (String)
•	Number of Pages (int)
The class should also have the following methods:
•	A method to return the title of the book.
•	A method to return the author of the book.
•	A method to return the ISBN of the book.
•	A method to return the publication date of the book.
•	A method to return the number of pages of the book.
•	A method to set the title of the book.
•	A method to set the author of the book.
•	A method to set the ISBN of the book.
•	A method to set the publication date of the book.
•	A method to set the number of pages of the book.
•	A method to check if the book is a long book (more than 500 pages).
•	A method to check if the book is a recent publication (publication date is within the last 5 years).
 ⁃ Once you have created the "Book" class, create a driver class that creates a few Book objects and sets and gets their properties. 

 ⁃ Then, use the methods you created in the Book class to check if each book is a long book and a recent publication.
