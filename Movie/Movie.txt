Create a Movie class that has the following fields:
•	title (String)
•	director (String)
•	releaseYear (int)
•	duration (int) in minutes
•	rating (double)
Implement the following methods in the Movie class:
•	A constructor that takes in all the fields as parameters and initializes them.
•	getTitle() and setTitle() methods that allow you to retrieve and set the value of the title field.
•	getDirector() and setDirector() methods that allow you to retrieve and set the value of the director field.
•	getReleaseYear() and setReleaseYear() methods that allow you to retrieve and set the value of the releaseYear field.
•	getDuration() and setDuration() methods that allow you to retrieve and set the value of the duration field.
•	getRating() and setRating() methods that allow you to retrieve and set the value of the rating field.
•	isLongMovie() method that returns true if the movie's duration is more than 2 hours (120 minutes), and false otherwise.
•	isHighlyRated() method that returns true if the movie's rating is higher than 4.0, and false otherwise.
Create a driver class that creates 3 Movie objects, sets their values, and then retrieves and displays all the fields of each object. 
Use the methods you implemented in the Movie class to print whether each movie is a long movie or a highly rated movie.
