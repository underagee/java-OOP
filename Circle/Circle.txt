Create a Java class Circle that has the following attributes:
•	radius (a double)
•	The class should have the following methods:
•	getArea(): This method should return the area of the circle, which is calculated as π * radius^2.
•	getCircumference(): This method should return the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as 2 * π * radius.
You should also write a Main class that creates two Circle objects, sets their radius, and demonstrates the use of each of the methods.
