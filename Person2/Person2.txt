Create a Java class Person with the following attributes:
•	name (a string)
•	age (an int)
•	address (a string)
The class should have the following methods:
 • getName(): This method should return the name of the person.
 • getAge(): This method should return the age of the person.
 • getAddress(): This method should return the address of the person.
 • setAddress(String address): This method should set the address of the person.
You should also write a Main class that creates two Person objects, sets their attributes, and demonstrates the use of each of the methods.
